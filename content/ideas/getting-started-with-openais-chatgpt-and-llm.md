* [When ChatGPT Broke an Entire Field: An Oral History](https://www.quantamagazine.org/when-chatgpt-broke-an-entire-field-an-oral-history-20250430/)
* [New Theory Suggests Chatbots Can Understand Text](https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-theory-suggests-chatbots-can-understand-text-20240122/)


Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being recognized for their potential to act as curators of knowledge and information, leveraging their ability to process, synthesize, and generate human-like text. They can be used to sift through vast amounts of data, extract relevant information, and present it in a clear and concise manner, effectively acting as a bridge between complex information and human understanding.



[ChatGPT][01], OpenAI’s text-generating AI chatbot,
was launch in November 2022 and has been steadly evolving ever since
(see evolutionary timeline [here][02].

Some typical ideas to Personalize ChatGPT Responses:

* You can use it to tailor response to match your skill level and and test your knowledge.
A custom GPT lets you explain what you want to learn, where you're starting from, and what areas are your strengths or weaknesses.
* Can ask ChatGPT to provide answers from multiple sources and identify those sources
* You can add your preferences to ChatGPT's memory, and when you search,
ChatGPT can use your preferences to give the types of results that you want and omit those that you don't.
* You can upload files to a custom GPT to provide it with information that it may not otherwise have.
For example, upload Home Assistant information that can be used when your having a problem with Home Assistant.
* and more...

By creating a custom GPT,
you don't need to have to set things up each time you want to use your personalized ChatGPT.
But there is a significant issue.
Custom GPTs don't save your conversation history,
so you can't stop in the middle of a conversation, you canot pick up from where you left off.
If you want to be able to do so, you might want to create a **Project in ChatGPT** instead,
which lets you apply custom instructions to multiple chats.

# Does LLM Size Matter?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are measured by the number of parameters they contain,
i.e. the number of weights and biases within the neural network.
More parameters mean a bigger, more complex model.
Models that you can run on your PC are somewhere between 1 billion and 70 billion parameters.
Does the size matter?
What about quantization ... Should you run models at full 32-bit precision,
or could 4-bit or 8-bit quantization suffice?

* [Does LLM Size Matter? How Many Billions of Parameters do you REALLY Need?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgSMRmW2frA)

# RAG

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is the de facto technique for giving LLMs the ability to interact with any document or dataset, regardless of its size.

# MSTY

Msty is a desktop application that lets you do several things.
First, it can let you chat with an AI engine either locally or remotely.
It knows about many popular options and can take your keys for paid services.
For local options, it can download, install, and run the engines of your choice.
For services or engines that it doesn’t know about, you can do your own setup,
which ranges from easy to moderately difficult, depending on what you are trying to do.
