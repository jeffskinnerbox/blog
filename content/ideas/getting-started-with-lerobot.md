# LeRobot

[LeRobot][02] is [Hugging Face][01] state-of-the-art machine learning platform for real-world robotics

* LeRobot aims to provide models, datasets, and tools for real-world robotics in PyTorch. The goal is to lower the barrier for entry to robotics so that everyone can contribute and benefit from sharing datasets and pretrained models.
* LeRobot contains state-of-the-art approaches that have been shown to transfer to the real-world with a focus on imitation learning and reinforcement learning.
* LeRobot already provides a set of pretrained models, datasets with human collected demonstrations, and simulated environments so that everyone can get started.
* LeRobot hosts pretrained models and datasets on the LeRobot HuggingFace page.
