#### Step 1: Configuring the Travel Router
The very first thing to do is to follow these steps:
1. Power the travel router with a USB-C 5V/4A source. (**NOTE:** Must be rated 4A or above when delivering 5V)
1. Using a PC with a browser, find the travel routers WiFi with the SSID listed above, and enter in the pass key.
1. Once your on the travel routers WiFi, enter in `192.168.8.1` in the browser.
   This should take you to the travel routers home screen (called a Setup Captive Portal)
   where you can begin to configure the travel router.

Within the Setup Captive Portal
