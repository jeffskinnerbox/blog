## Gradio
[Gradio][01] (pronounced _GRAY-dee-oh_) is an open-source Python library that simplifies the creation of user-friendly web interfaces for
machine learning models, APIs, or any Python function.
Initially developed as a way to help machine learning practitioners showcase their models.
You can then share a link to your demo or web application in just a few seconds using Gradio's built-in sharing features.
No JavaScript, CSS, or web hosting experience needed!
Gradio is the fastest way to demo your machine learning model with a friendly web interface so that anyone can use it, anywhere!

## Hugging Face
[Hugging Face][06] is a company and a community-driven open-source platform that provides tools,
pre-trained models, and datasets for machine learning, particularly in natural language processing (NLP).
It is known for its popular [transformers][07] library and a central hub where users
can collaborate, share, and discover AI projects.
Think of it as a GitHub for AI, making it easier for both beginners and experienced developers
to build, train, and deploy machine learning models.

### Hugging Face Spaces
[Hugging Face Spaces][02] offer a simple way to host ML demo apps directly on your profile or your organization’s profile.
This allows you to create your ML portfolio, showcase your projects at conferences or to stakeholders,
and work collaboratively with other people in the ML ecosystem.
Hugging Face has built-in support for an SDK that let you rapidly build apps in Python in a matter of minutes [Gradio][01]

You’ll also upgrade your Space to run on a GPU or other accelerated hardware
or leverage platforms like [Modal][03].
