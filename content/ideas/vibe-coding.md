The term “[vibe coding][01]” coined by Andrej Karpathy, cofounder of OpenAI,
is a style of code writing where you direct AI to build a code base from your description of what is needed.
In Kaprathy’s words:
“it’s not really coding — I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.”
The basic idea is instead of trained software developers literal writing code,
anyone can direct AI, via a series of well selected prompts, build your software application.
Your reducing the gap between someone with an idea for a software system and the creating of that system.

This puts a premium on people with great ideas, elegant, and skilled execution.
It is like difference between an Uncle Fred taking your wedding pictures and a professional photographer.
Both use photographic equipment but the professionals work is allway judged better.
When anyone (even non-engineers, non-developers) can rapidly generate a working prototype,
tech jobs will profoundly change.
[Harris Sockel say it well][01]:

1. **Product Managers** can’t hide behind documents and wireframes — they’ll need to generate working prototypes
2. **Designers** can’t simply hand off mock-ups — they’ll need to implement their designs
3. **Marketers** can’t request custom tools — they’ll build their own analytics dashboards
4. **Executives** can’t claim technical ignorance — they’ll need to understand the systems they oversee

The computer/electrical engineers and software developers of today will need to be more
like [systems engineers][02] of today.
Not at the enterprise level, that is typical of today's system engineering,
more low level, small, well defined operational components that can be connected like Lagos.
They will re-engineer what the product manager/designer/marketer/executive has proposed,
and they will modify it fit with the business.
