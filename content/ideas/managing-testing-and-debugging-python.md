# Next-gen Python Tooling
Over the years, legacy Python has created multiple tools & procedures to manage the Python interpreter,
the software project using Python code, the modules/libraries used by Python,
and the command-line tool used to format/lint/validate/build/document/publish Python code.
Not all these tools work well together and they also over lap in their functional role.
This can cause even an experience Python developer confusion & difficulties.
This challenge has stimulated the effort to create a more unified tool, called `uv`, to address this problem.

[`uv`][01] is a single tool who's mission is to replace
[`pip`][02], [`pipx`][03], [`pip-tools`][04], [`poetry`][05], [`pyenv`][06], [`twine`][07], [`virtualenv`][08], and more.
[`ruff`][09] can be used to replace [Flake8][10] (plus dozens of plugins), [Black][11], [`isort`][12], [`pydocstyle`][13], [`pyupgrade`][14], [`autoflake`][15], and more,
all while executing tens or hundreds of times faster than any individual tool.

**Question:**
* I'm using existing Python environments and I'm pleased with what I can do.
  So, the questions becomes: Does the value provided by `uv` justify having another tool installed on my system?
  Why not just stick with Python tooling and accept `pip` or `venv` will be slightly slower?
  What am I missing here?

**Answer:**
* Do you build images regularly? `uv` is phenomenal in that context.
* Do you try and share you code with other people, who have different computers than you? Again, `uv` shines.
* Do you want global access to python-based tools across different projects,
  without the headache of managing tool-specific virtual environments? `uv` is for you.
* `uv` actually resolves your python version.
  We often get devs who last interacted with a service 1+ minor versions of python ago.
  A lot of libraries and `stdlib` stuff doesn't work right with pinned packages on an older version.
  The troubleshooting can take some time and is an easy solve, but is annoying.
  The fact that `uv` resolves the python versioning via [`uv sync`][18] is miles ahead of pip tools.

This last point cannot be overstated.
The fact that `uv` can, on the fly, download the correct version of Python modules,
compatible with the target OS and architecture,
is a game changer and takes it from a handy tool to indispensable.
Sure, that could be managed in different ways,
but the simplicity of setting up your entire environment from scratch with `uv sync` is just marvelous.

## Python Version vs Python Project Management
Your going to be using two primary tools:

* [`pyenv`][06] manages your Python versions
* [`uv`][01] manages your project's virtual environment and packages

`uv` cannot perform the same core tasks as `pyenv`.
They don't conflict; they complement each other.
`uv` will use the Python version that `pyenv` has made active for your project.
Think of it like this: `pyenv` manages the workshop (i.e. manages Python versions),
and `uv` manages the project on the workbench (i.e. manages virtual environments & project packages).

Here is the standard workflow that shows how `uv` and `pyenv` interact seamlessly.

1. Create Your Project Directory -
In an effort to organize and isolate your project,
you need to create a project directory, initialized properly via `pyenv` and `uv`.

```bash
# create your new project directory called "my-project"
uv init my-project
```

2. Select Your Python Version with `pyenv` -
First, you tell `pyenv` which version of Python you want to use for your project.
This is usually done on a per-project basis.

```bash
# navigate to your project directory
cd my-project

# tell pyenv to use Python 3.11.8 for this directory specifically
pyenv local 3.11.8

# check that you python version has been update
cat .python-version
# or
pyenv version
```

3. Activate and Use Your Environment -
Now you can activate the environment and use `uv` to install packages and build your project

```bash
# run the projectâ€™s entry-point script
uv run main.py

# activate the environment
cd my-project
source .venv/bin/activate

# use uv to install packages into the active environment
uv pip install flask ruff
```

---------------

## Complete Python Project Development Workflow
With `uv`, you can install and manage multiple Python versions, create virtual environments,
efficiently handle project dependencies, reproduce working environments, and even build and publish a project.
These capabilities make `uv` an all-in-one tool for Python project management.

* `uv` is a Python package and project manager that integrates multiple functionalities into one tool,
  offering a comprehensive solution for managing Python projects.
* `uv` is used for fast dependency installation, virtual environment management, Python version management,
  and project initialization, enhancing productivity and efficiency.
* `uv` can build and publish Python packages to package repositories like PyPI,
  supporting a streamlined process from development to distribution.
* `uv` automatically handles virtual environments, creating and managing them as needed to ensure clean
  and isolated project dependencies.

### Installing / Updating / Uninstalling `uv` & `pyenv`

#### Step 1: Install uv & pyenv
`uv` provides a standalone installer to download and install `uv`.
This places `uv` files in your `~/.local` directory:

```bash
# install uv & pyenv on your system using the recommended installer
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer/master/bin/pyenv-installer | bash

# check your uv install
$ whereis uv
uv: /usr/include/uv /home/jeff/.local/bin/uv

$ uv --version
uv 0.8.18

# check your pyenv install
$ whereis pyenv
pyenv: /home/jeff/.pyenv/bin/pyenv

$ pyenv --version
pyenv 2.6.8
```

#### Step 2: Upgrading to the Latest uv Version
The `uv` project is currently under active development, which means that new versions are released regularly.
If youâ€™ve installed `uv` using the standalone installer (as we did here)
and would like to be up to date with the latest version, then you can run the following command:

```bash
# upgrade uv
uv self update

# upgrade pyenv
pyenv update
```

#### Step 3: Uninstall uv & pyenv
If you wish to uninstall `uv`, not that the
`uv` installer script (`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`)
puts `uv` into your home directory under `~/.local/bin/uv`.
So to uninstall uv, you can simply delete the binary and any cached files:

```bash
# remove the binary uv & pyenv
rm -f ~/.local/bin/uv
rm -rf $(pyenv root)

# remove uv cache, config, data
rm -rf ~/.cache/uv
rm -rf ~/.local/share/uv
rm -rf ~/.config/uv
```

### Creating Python Project

#### Step 1: Create Python Project
To create and initialize a Python project with `uv`,
navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.
Once there, you can run the following command to create and initialize the project:

```bash
# create your project directory and initialize it as project "my-project"
uv init my-project

# if you have already created a project directory for your new project called "my-project"
cd my-project
uv init

# the resulting project structure created
$ tree -a --filesfirst $HOME/..../my-project/

$HOME/..../my-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ .python-version
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ .git
```

>**NOTE:** If you want to start managing an existing project with `uv`,
>then navigate to the project directory and run the following command: `uv init`.
>This command will create the `uv` project structure for you.
>It wonâ€™t overwrite the `main.py` file if you have one, but itâ€™ll create the file if itâ€™s missing.
>It neither modifies your Git repository nor your `README.md` file.
>
>However, this command wonâ€™t work if you already have a `pyproject.toml` file in place.
>If thatâ€™s the case, then you can move the file to another location and run the `uv init` command.
>Finally, you can update the new file with any relevant configuration from your old `pyproject.toml`.

#### Step 2: Run the Projectâ€™s Entry-Point Script
Once youâ€™ve created the project, you can use `uv` to run the entry-point script,
which is the `main.py` file by default.
This action will automatically create for you a virtual environment via a `.venv` directory.
To run the script, go ahead and execute the following command:

```bash
# run the projectâ€™s entry-point script
$ uv run main.py
Using CPython 3.12.3 interpreter at: /usr/bin/python3.12
Creating virtual environment at: .venv
Hello from my-project!
```

>**Note:** You can change the entry-point scriptâ€™s name and location at any time.
>Naming it `main.py` isnâ€™t mandatory.

#### Step 3: Install Desired Python Version
Before Step 2 (aka before creating the `.venv`), or now,
you are free to change the version of Python you will be operating under.
If you want to change to Python version 3.13.7, do this as follows:

```bash
# change you python version to 3.13.7 in you virtual environment
pyenv local 3.13.7

# check that you python version has been update
cat .python-version
# or
pyenv version
```






### Syncing Your Environment
The `uv sync` command is designed to keep your virtual environment aligned with your project's dependency requirements.
When you run `vu sync`, `uv` compares the current state of your environment against the
dependencies specified in your `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` files.

So if you have a `venv`, `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` managed project,
the `uv sync` command installs / updates all dependencies specified in the `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` files.
It performs the following actions:

* **Installation**: Installs any missing dependencies that are listed in your requirements but not yet present in your environment.
* **Upgrades/Downgrades**: Adjusts the versions of existing packages to match the versions specified in your requirements.
  This ensures that your environment is using the exact versions youâ€™ve defined,
  which is crucial for avoiding unexpected behavior due to version mismatches.
* **Uninstallation**: Removes any packages that are installed in the environment but not listed in your requirements,
  keeping the environment clean and free from unnecessary bloat.

# Python Static Analysis Tools

As projects grow in complexity, ensuring code quality and security becomes paramount.
There are many Python static analysis tools to choose from, but these are most helpful:

* [`black`](https://pypi.org/project/black/) uncompromising Python code formatter.
  It saves you from the minutiae of hand-formatting and freedom from nagging about formatting.
  Install `black` with `pip install black`.
  (**NOTE:** If you want to format Jupyter Notebooks, install with `pip install "black[jupyter]"`.)
* [`mypy`](https://mypy-lang.org/) is a static type checking tool.
  You can freely mix static and dynamic typing within a program,
  within a module or within an expression.
  No need to give up dynamic typing â€” use static typing when it makes sense.
  Install `mypy` with `pip install mypy`.
* [`ty`](https://realpython.com/python-ty/) is a static type checking tool.
  This new tool delivers a lightning-fast static type-checking experience in Python
  At the time of writing, `ty` is available as an early preview release.
  If youâ€™d like to get familiar with a new, robust, and promising type checker in your personal projects, then by all means give ty a try!
* [`flake8`](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) is a bundle of
  [`pyflakes`](https://pypi.org/project/pyflakes/), [`pycodestyle`](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/),
  and [`mccabe`](https://pypi.org/project/mccabe/).
  It is faster than Pylint largely because Flake8 only examines the syntax tree of each file individually.
  Install `flake8` with `pip install flake8`.
* [`pylint`](https://www.pylint.org/) is a static code analyzer for Python 2 or 3.
  Pylint analyses your code without actually running it.
  It checks for errors, enforces a coding standard, looks for [code smells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell),
  and can make suggestions about how the code could be refactored.
  Its follows the [PEP 8 style guide for Python code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
  Install `pylint` with `pip install pylint`.
* [`ruff`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) aims to be orders of magnitude faster than
  alternative tools while integrating more functionality behind a single, common interface.
  Its objective is to replace `black`, `flake8`, `pylint`, and more.
  Install `ruff` with `pip install ruff`.

# Python Development Environment / Dev Containerized Environment

If you have more than one Python project,
your going to want to setup separate development environments.
The very act of setting up these environments and maintaining them can be laborious,
even with the aid of Python's virtual environment tools.
And if your sharing a project with teammates,
you have to coordinate the environments across space & time.
A good remedy for this can be containerization of your Python development environment.

# IPython & Jupyter & JupyterLab

[IPython](https://ipython.org/) is an alternative interactive interpreter to the standard Python interpreter that ships with the language.
The standard interpreter is useful for testing out small snippets of code and learning the language, but its functionality is basic. IPython adds a lot of features that are useful if you make much more extensive use of interactive Python.

IPython enhances Python's interactive mode with syntax highlighting and magic commands.
It offers built-in help, tab completion, and the ability to run system commands within Python.
You can log sessions for review, further enhancing IPython's functionality.

One of IPython's spinoffs is the popular notebook interface [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), which is popular in scientific computing.
Jupyter is available in two flavors: the standard Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab. The latter is intended to be a fuller-featured version, similar to an IDE. The Jupyter project even deprecated the older Jupyter and put it into maintenance mode, but eventually pulled the original Jupyter out of mothballs and maintains both simultaneously due to its continuing popularity.

# Regular Expressions Using Python

A regex is a special sequence of characters that is used to extract part of a string, or detect a particular string pattern.
Regular expressions have become an integral part of natural language processing (NLP) and are very useful in the fields of text processing, information extraction and more.

There are some special characters in the field of regular expressions,
which help us perform different tasks.
These are:

```text
\ - drop special meaning of char
[] - represents a character class/set of characters
^ - Beginning of an expression
$ - Ending of an expression
. - Any character except the new line character (â€˜\nâ€™)
| - Means OR - Matches with characters that are separated by it
? - Matches zero or One occurrence (Verifies whether the given character is there or not)
* - If the given character occurred zero or more times
+ - If the given character occurred one or more times
{}- The number occurrences of a preceding regex needed to match
()- Used to enclose a group of Regex
\ - To remove the special values of these characters
```

## Making a Main Function

In Python, there's a way to ask, are we being run from the command-line or being imported as a module?
Or put another way, is our current Python module the entry point to our Python process?
This question can be asked using the statements like this:

```python
def main():
    .
    .
    .

if __name__ == "__main__"
    main()
```

If you need to make a single Python file that can both be **used as a module** (i.e. is being imported)
and can be **run as a Python script** to do something,
you can check the variable `__name__` in your module to see whether it's equal to the string `"__main__"`.

When ever we run a file, Python automatically creates `__name__`, `__main__`, `__file__`, `__doc__`, etc.
These special variables are called "Dunders", which is short for double underscore.

## Python's Built-in Functions

Python has many built-in functions that you can use directly without importing anything.
These functions cover a wide variety of common programming tasks that include performing math operations,
working with built-in data types, processing iterables of data, handling input and output in your programs, working with scopes, and more.

## Python Scope

In programming, the scope of a name defines the region of a program where you can unambiguously access that name, which could identify a variable, constant, function, class, or any other object.
Nearly all programming languages use the concept of scope to avoid name collisions and unpredictable behavior.
Python resolves names using whatâ€™s known as the **LEGB rule**, which defines the order in which the interpreter searches through distinct scopes. The letters in this acronym stand for Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in.

## List & Dictionary Comprehension in Python

List  & dictionary comprehension is a way to create these object using a concise syntax.
It allows us to generate a new list/dictionaries by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable (such as a list or range).
This helps us to write cleaner, more readable code compared to traditional looping techniques.

# Python's Import Statement

The Python `import` statement lets you read (aka copy) a module into your code.
A module, sometimes called packages, is any file that contains
classes, functions, and values that you can reference from your program.
In short, Python modules are `.py` files that contain Python code.

We could import the Python `time` module and make use of the `sleep()` function via the following code:

```python
import time

time.sleep(3)
```

The above `import` statement allows you to import all the functions from a module into your code.
Often, though, youâ€™ll only want to import a few functions, or just one.
that can be done via:

```python
from random import choice

fruits = ["Apple", "Pear", "Banana"]
print(choice(fruits))
```

The default name given to modules in your code is the name of the module.
However, you can override the default module name using the `as` keyword.

```python
import tkinter as tk

window = tk.Tk()
```

TOML stands for Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language.
Its human-readable syntax makes TOML convenient to parse into data structures across various programming languages.
In Python, you can use the built-in `tomllib` module to work with TOML files.
TOML plays an essential role in the Python ecosystem.

## pyproject.toml
`pyproject.toml` is crucial for package configuration and specifies the build system and dependencies. Modern Python projects use pyproject.toml files to describe a project's metadata, dependencies, and other valuable attributes.

## settings.toml
`settings.toml` file serves as a dedicated location for storing configuration variables and sensitive information, particularly for network-connected devices. This method **does not** make them secure. It only separates them from the code.

# Pickle Module

In Python, the `pickle` module lets you serialize and deserialize data.
Essentially, this means that you can convert a Python object into a stream of bytes
