[n8n][01] is an open-source workflow automation platform that connects APIs, databases, and services.
In practical terms, it allows non-programmers to build complex systems using a visual interface,
while offering developers a powerful and scalable way to design automations.
It's one of the most popular platforms for deploying AI agents,
combining triggers, language models (LLMs), and external tools.
