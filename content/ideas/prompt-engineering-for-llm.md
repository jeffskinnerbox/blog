# Effective LLM Prompting
Mastering the art of prompting comes with practice and is a continuous process.
Practicing and refining the prompting skills allows us to extract more value from AI interactions.
It is similar to experiment design while building anything for your first time.

## Prompting Framework
A prompting framework lays down the groundwork for a clear ask,
but it also adds the necessary context and describes the persona to tailor the response to the specific situation.
Asking the model to show how it arrives at the results adds further depth.
