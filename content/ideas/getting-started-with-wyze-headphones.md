## Left vs Right

To determine the left from the right ear cup on your Wyze Noise-Cancelling Headphones,
look for the "L" and "R" markings inside the ear cups.
Equvalently, note that the over-the-head brace of the headphone fold behind the ear.
Additionally, the power button and touch controls are located on the right ear cup.


## Power On/Off Headphones

To turn on the headphones,
press the power button located on the right ear cup once.
You'll know the headphones are powered on when the status light shows a solid blue light,
indicating they are connected to the Wyze app.

To turn off the headphones,
press the button again and then the status light turns red and goes off.


## Noise-Cancelling Modes

You can switch between different noise cancellation modes via a button on the left earcup or through the Wyze app.
Using the button on the left earcup to toggle between High Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), Low ANC, and Transparency Mode.

* **High ANC (Active Noise Cancellation):** This mode provides maximum noise reduction,
allowing you to immerse yourself in your music or calls without external distractions.
* **Low ANC:** A less intense noise cancellation option for when you want some awareness
of your surroundings while still reducing background noise.
* **Transparency Mode:** This mode amplifies outside sounds,
enabling you to hear your environment clearly while still wearing the headphones.
It's perfect for situations where you need to stay aware,
like listening for announcements or having a quick conversation.
