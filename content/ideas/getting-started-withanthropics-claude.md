# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard and open-source framework that aims to standardize how AI systems,
particularly large language models (LLMs), interact with external tools, data sources, and services.
It essentially acts as a universal translator,
allowing AI models to seamlessly access and utilize information from diverse systems.
